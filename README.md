# Disney ASL

The primary goal of this application is to ignite children's enthusiasm for learning American Sign Language and encourage them to maintain their commitment through a streak tracking feature. As a user, you have the option to select your preferred profile character and monitor your daily streaks. The main appeal of this application is so that users can input their own word into the text box and let the application convert it into ASL hand gestures. ðŸ¤Ÿ
